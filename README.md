## weui-picker

[weui](https://github.com/Tencent/weui) picker/datePicker stand-alone version, also supports flexible.js.
You can view **picker/datePicker** in the [demo](https://weui.io/weui.js/).

### Install

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cenxky/weui-picker
```

### Usage
weui picker/datePicker is as same as picker in wechat mini-apps([微信小程序](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/debug/wxadoc/dev/component/picker.html)), it's beautiful and as well as usable.
Please use the `/flexible` version if your project set up with flexible.js([阿里高清方案](https://www.jianshu.com/p/985d26b40199)), the css uses `rem`, instead of `px`.

#### global

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./weui-picker.min.css">
<script type="text/javascript" src="./weui-picker.min.js"></script>
```

#### import as module
```javascript
import 'weui-picker';
import weui from 'weui-picker.js'; // there are picker and datePicker functions only in weui
```
